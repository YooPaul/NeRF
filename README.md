# PyTorch Implementation of NeRF (Work In Progress...)
<!--[![Open NeRF in
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YooPaul/NeRF/blob/master/NeRF.ipynb)<br>-->
Will add a Colab notebook with comments and explanation of the code and model training pipeline. <br>

### TODOs

* Run the pipeline on the forward facing dataset used by the authors and also experiment with my custom 360 view images   

### Dataset

Currently working with images of custom objects/scenes with their camera poses estimated via SfM [2, 3].
